            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap> he was. The ſum and ſubſtance of his charge is this: Firſt, <hi>That they would not be high-minded</hi> that is to ſay, lofty, proud, and ſcornful diſdain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look upon thoſe that are poor. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That they would not truſt in uncertain Riches but in the living God.</hi> Men are apt to think themſelves ſafe and ſecure, if they have gotten but Eſtates in their hands: but the Word of God ſaith otherwiſe. The Apoſtle here calle Richee uncertain: and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of them that they are vanity of vanities, moor empty no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thing, things which we ought not to covet after for we came into the world naked without rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and it is certain we ſhall carry none with us
<pb facs="tcp:108227:3"/>out of the world. Then as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>1 Tim. 6.8. Let us having food and raiment be there with all content:</hi> But if we will not, what ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the next Verſe? <hi>If men will be rich, they fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and perdition. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the love of money is the root of all evil.</hi> And then thirdly, and laſtly, he charges them, <hi>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate.</hi> And the reaſons why we ſhould do ſo, are theſe: Firſt, that we receive all we have from God; he gives us all things rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy. Then ſecondly, by doing good and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the neceſſities of thoſe that are in want, we do thereby lay up in ſtore for our ſelves a good foundation for eternal life. God will not forget our work and labour of love towards the Poor. <hi>Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto them, ye have done it unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth,</hi> 25.40. And whatſoever we give unto the Poor, we lend unto the Lord, and he will certainly repay us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let all thoſe who expects mercy and favours form the Lord, ſeriouſly conſider, and minde theſe following motives &amp; inducements to Charity, propounded by a godly Miniſter: a neceſſary Duty, which divers men are very prone to neglect. <hi>Dives</hi> would not give the

                  <p>Firſt, It is an argument of Covetouſneſs: When Chriſt, <hi>Luke 16.9.</hi> vids them make to themſelves friends of the Mammon of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, (which he ſo calls, becauſe men ſin either in the getting or in the uſing of them) ſaying they could not ſerve God and Mammon. In the <hi>13.</hi> Verſe it is ſaid, the Phariſées who were covetous derided him: They thought Chriſt ſpake like an ignorant man; they could ſerve God, and kéep their wealth too, and not caſt it away upon poor people. This ſhewed their covetouſneſs; and what an evil covetouſneſs is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, A covetous man is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Epheſ. 5.5.</hi> and hath no inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                     <hi>2.</hi> Vnmercifulneſs is an argument of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and diſtruſt of God; men think, if they give to the poor they muſt want themſelves. But <hi>Prov. 28.27. He that giveth to the poor ſhall never lack.</hi> Here is the word of God for it, who is Truth it ſelf; and yet men diſtruſt God, and think of other wayes to provide for themſelves. I will keep what I have (ſaith the Covetous man) if this be gone, I know not where to have more: the world is hard, and it is beſt to keep
<pb facs="tcp:108227:4"/>what we have. Thus unbelief diſcovers it ſelf. Saith God, give to the poor, and thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lack; ſaith the hard-hearted man, Give to the poor, and thou ſhalt lack, and ſo gives God the lye, <hi>Eccleſ. 11.1. Caſt thy bread upon the water, and after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it:</hi> No, ſaith the unmerciful man, I ſhall never ſee it again; and ſo makes God a Lyar, and declares himſelf an unbeliever.</p>

                     <hi>3.</hi> Unmercifulneſs is an argument that there is no love of God in that man, <hi>1 John 3.17.

No man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it</hi> When men therefore refuſe of ſtrengthen the hand of the poor and needy, they deſpiſe and hate their own fleſh, they are unnatural: and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, God hath laid a command to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, where the ſtrongeſt reaſon and plea may be againſt it, <hi>Prov. 25.21.

Holy <hi>Job</hi> was a father to the poor, ſee his 29.

                  <p>Spare ſomething out of your Superfluities for them.

Can you ſpend bounds and pounds to ſatisfie and pleaſe your carnal luſts, in a ſuperfluous manner, and can you not now and then ſpare a penny to a poor Chriſtian? how will the Lord take this at your bands?</p>
                  <p>Remember <hi>Dives,</hi> he had been better to have given all to poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> then to have met with ſuch an end for his unmercifulneſs.

                     <hi>2.</hi> Affirmatively, by <hi>putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and denying of the works of the fleſh; and the motives here laid down, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle enjoyns this duty, are theſe in the <hi>12.</hi> verſe, <hi>The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand, therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let us caſt off the works of darkneſs, and let us put on the armout of light.</hi> Where by the way, we may obſerve, that works of darkneſs are very unſuitable and unſeaſonable to the times of the Goſpel, light and darkneſs are contrary. In the words then you ſee, <hi>1.</hi> Here is a duty exhorted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that is laid down in the <hi>12.</hi> verſe. And then <hi>2.</hi> you have here alſo the Apoſtles
<pb facs="tcp:108227:14"/>amplification and illuſtration of this duty here exhorted unto, and that is ſet down par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the <hi>13.</hi> and <hi>14.</hi> verſes. The duty exhorted unto you ſee here is two-fold. <hi>1.</hi> Here is ſomething to be caſt off. And then <hi>2.</hi> Here is ſomething to be put on. <hi>1.</hi> The things to be caſt off, are the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>2.</hi> The things to be put on, are the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of light: <hi>Let us caſt off the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and let us put on the armor of light:</hi> and as the exhortation is two-fold, ſo like wiſe are the reaſons whereupon the Apoſtle grounds his exhortation alſo. <hi>1. The night is far ſpent.</hi> And <hi>2. the day is at hand.</hi> Before I proceed to the obſervation, give me leave a little to open the words unto you; and firſt, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew what is here meant by the night, and then ſecondly, what is here meant by the day: by the night here may be meant the times of darkneſs and ignorance, in which the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles lived in before the breaking forth of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and thoſe times may very well be compared to the night for theſe three reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the night men cannot ſo well ſee their way, and therefore may the more eaſily wander out of their way; for it is onely the want of light that makes men to erre.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> In the night no thing is viſible or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
<pb facs="tcp:108227:15"/>but darkneſs, all light is then extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; the blinde man is not able to value or judge what a mercy it is to have the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enjoyment of the light of the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> The night is the moſt ſuitableſt time and ſeaſon for the doing of evil in, in <hi>Job 24. 14, 15, 16. The murderer</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job riſing with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. The eye alſo of the adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er waiteth for the twilight, ſaying, No eye ſhall ſee me, and diſguiſeth his face. In the dark they dig through houſes,</hi> they know not the light, <hi>They that are drunk</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are drunk in the night, 1 Theſ. 5.7. in Pſal. 25.20. The dark places of the earth are full of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of cruelty.</hi> And then ſecondly, by the day here is meant the times of the Goſpel, it is night in the ſoul, till ſuch time as the day light of the Goſpel breaks forth and ſhines into it, <hi>Matth. 4.16. The people which ſate in darkneſs ſaw a great light, and to them that ſate in the region and ſhadow of death, light is ſprung up.</hi> In <hi>John 13.19. Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather then light;</hi> and why ſo, the reaſon is (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved, Epheſ. 5.8. Ye were ſometimes darkneſs,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but now
<pb facs="tcp:108227:15"/>are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.</hi> In <hi>1 Pet. 2.9. God hath called us out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light. Luke 1.78, 79. The day ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs.</hi> In <hi>Acts 26.17.18.</hi> the Apoſtle was ſent to the Gentiles, <hi>to turn them from darkneſs unto light.</hi> In <hi>1 John 2.8. The darkneſs is paſt, and the true light</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>now ſhineth.</hi> In <hi>Acts 17.30.</hi> The times of Heatheniſme are there called the times of ignorance, and it muſt needs be night in ſuch ſouls wherein Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs never did ariſe; as it is never day in the world until the Sun ariſeth, ſo it is never day in the ſoul till Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſeth <hi>with healing in his wings.</hi> Now there are ſeveral uſeful and profitable points of doctrine, which naturally flow from hence for our inſtruction and edification, I ſhall onely name them, and ſo procéed to that which I chiefly intend.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point of doctrine is this, that works of darkneſs are works of the night, night works.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the times of the Goſpel are times of light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that in the day of the Goſpel all theſe works of darkneſs are to be caſt off: when the Sun ſhines, it diſpels and ſcatters
<pb facs="tcp:108227:16"/>all thoſe miſts and fogs of darkneſs that lie upon the earth; ſo when Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſes in the ſoul, he diſpells and ſcatters all thoſe miſts and fogs of ſin and wickedneſs which naturally ariſeth in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in Goſpel times, or times of light, men ſhould live Goſpel lives, or walk in the light of the Goſpel: while ye have light walk as children of the light. <hi>Walk</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John 5.35, 36.) while ye have light, leſt darkneſs come upon you: for he that walketh in darkneſs knoweth not whither he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that rioting and drunkenneſs, chambering and wantonneſs, ſtrife and envy, are not works of the day, but of the night.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, they that would live as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſhould caſt off all thoſe unfruitful works of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, that Ieſus Chriſt is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans garment.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, that Ieſus Chriſt is a garment to be put on.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, that all of Chriſt, whole Chriſt is to be put on; put ye on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt as a King to rule you, as a Prieſt to offer up himſelf a ſacrifice for you, and as a
<pb facs="tcp:108227:16"/>Prophet to teach and inſtruct you.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly and laſtly, that the putting on of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is accompanied with the caſting off all ſinful and fleſhly works.</p>
                  <p>Now the point of doctrine that I ſhall chiefly inſiſt upon ſhall be this, namely, that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is a garment; in handling whereof I ſhall briefly touch upon, and ſpeak ſomething to all the reſt by way of uſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. The Doctrine then to be inſiſted upon is this, That the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is a Chriſtians garment; in handling whereof, I ſhall endeavour by the aſſiſtance of God to ſhew you firſt wherein the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is or may be ſaid to be a garment. And here I ſhall endeavour by the aſſiſtance of God to ſhew you the natural agreement and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that is between the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and our natural garments. Firſt, wherein they do agree, and ſecondly, wherein they do not agree; and having done this, in the next place, God willing, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you what kinde of garment Chriſt is, and how this garment is to be worn. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laſtly, to whom and for what he is a garment; and then having done this, I ſhall briefly endeavour to give you ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections by way of motives to perſwade you to the putting on of this garment, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb facs="tcp:108227:17"/>all by the aſſiſtance of God in a word or two of uſe and application. I begin with the firſt of theſe, wherein the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is or may be ſaid to be a garment, and this will appear briefly in theſe two things.

<pb facs="tcp:108227:17"/>our garments are to our bodies, the ſame, and much more is Chriſt to our ſouls: now the natural uſe of our natural garments are chiefly theſe thrée.
<list>
                        <item>1. Our natural garments are for neceſſity.</item>
                        <item>2. For diſtinction.</item>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, for neceſſity our natural gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are neceſſary, yea, they are of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, we cannot be well without them; they are needful for us to cover and ſhelter us, to cheriſh and preſerve our weak, frail, naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, from all the dangers and incumbrances which would irreſiſtably fall upon us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of them. Our garments are uſeful to cover and preſerve us from the cold bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtorms of the world, how unable would our frail weak mortal bodies be to ſubſiſt and live without the natural uſe of our natural garments, to cheriſh and preſerve us; and this, and more then this doth Chriſt to our ſouls: as our bodies are not able to ſubſiſt without cloaths, no more are our ſouls able to ſubſiſt without Chriſt, who is the life and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſouls: as our natural garments ſerve to defend us from the cold bluſtering ſtorms of the weather, ſo Chriſt the garment of our ſouls preſerves and ſhelters us from all thoſe raging aſſaults of Satan, which in the world we are often, yea, alwayes lyable unto.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:108227:18"/>
                  <p> Secondly, as our natural garments ſerve to defend us from the cold ſtormes of winde and weather, ſo likewiſe they ſerve to defend us from the violent and ſcorching heat of the Sun: as in the bluſtering ſtorms of rain and cold, our garments preſerves us from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under them; ſo in the violent ſcorching heat of the Sun, our garments ſerve to keep us from being melted and devoured by its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſcorching heat: of the like uſe is Chriſt to our ſouls; as 'tis onely Chriſt that can preſerve us from the cold bluſtering ſtorms of the world, ſo 'tis onely Chriſt that can preſerve us from the violent and ſcorching heat of perſecutions and fiery tryals in the world. A ſecond uſe of our natural garments is for diſtinction, to diſtinguiſh between ſex and ſex, noble and ignoble, high and low, rich and poor, magiſtrates and people; ſo likewiſe Chriſt is a garment for diſtinction, yea, it is the onely diſtinguiſhing garment in the world. Chriſt diſtinguiſheth the ſaint from the ſinner, the holy from the unholy, the ſheep from the wolves, yea, the true ſheep from the wolves in ſheeps cloathing, the ſincere and upright ſouls from formal falſhood, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Profeſſors; and as it diſtinguiſheth the ſaints from ſinners here, ſo it will alſo diſtinguiſh them hereafter, they that have not
<pb facs="tcp:108227:18"/>on this garment at the laſt day, ſhall be ſet on the left hand of Chriſt in judgment; its this wedding garment that diſtinguiſheth who are the gueſts for the marriage feaſt, there is no coming to heaven without it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the natural uſe of our natural garments are for ornament, our uncomely parts being cloathed become abundant more comely; our bodies being decked and adorned by clothing, although in themſelves uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do thereby become beautiful and lovely: of the like uſe is Chriſt to our ſouls; there is nothing in the world, beloved, that will ſo adorn your ſouls as this garment of Chriſt; yea, it is the onely becoming garment, it will make your ſouls amiable and lovely, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lovely, our ſouls being cloathed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with this garment of Chriſt and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, will appear lovely and beautiful in the eyes of God himſelf, and by it we are made to be acceptable in the Lord; as we are in our ſelves, we are vile, wretched, ſinful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed creatures, altogether unlovely, but in Chriſt we are made to be amiable and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yea, altogether love. Having thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you the reſemblances between Chriſt and our natural garments, and having ſhewed you briefly wherein they do agree, I ſhall now in a word or two, ſhew you wherein they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree,
<pb facs="tcp:108227:19"/>or rather wherein this ſpiritual an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> diſagreement.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, our natural garments are not dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they will laſt us but a little while before they be quite worn out; but Ieſus Chriſt is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> durable and laſting garment, yea, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting garment that will never be worn out while thou liveſt, though thou liveſt never ſo long, it will laſt thee for ever and ever, both here and hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our natural garments they are the worſe for wearing, yea, the longer we wear them the worſe they grow; and at the laſt, by being overworne, they come to be worth nothing? I, but it is not thus with Chriſt, this heavenly garment of Chriſt is the better for wearing, and the longer we wear it, the better it is; and the better we are, it doth not onely grow better it ſelf, but it alſo makes us grow better. I, but it is not thus with our natural garments, they if they be worn often, or by often wearing, they grow worſe and worſe, and at laſt they decay.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our natural garments as we put them on in the morning, ſo we put them off at night; but where ever Ieſus Chriſt is put on
<pb facs="tcp:108227:19"/>as a garment, he is not, nay, he cannot be put off again; Chriſt is a garment as well for the night as for the day: the ſoul that hath once given up it ſelf to Chriſt, by a true and ſaving faith, can never be taken away, I mean not finally from Chriſt, by all the craft and policy of the devil; they that are choſen by God in Chriſt, ſhall be preſerved by God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our natural garments grow out of faſhion very often and ſuddenly, but Ieſus Chriſt is a garment that will never be out of faſhion; a better then which can never be magined nor invented. Ieſus Chriſt is a garment as well for Summer as for Winter, for all weathers; in the Summer heat of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and tryale, Chriſt is a garment, hither to keep them off, or elſe to ſuſtain us under them: and in the Winter of adverſity Ieſus Chriſt is a garment to defend and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh us from all evils; let the ſtorms be never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Fifthly, our natural garments they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:108227:20"/>if they fit one, they are either too big or too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for another; but Ieſus Chriſt is a garment fit, or made fit for all ſouls, for ſouls of all ſorts; a garment for men, and a garment for women: a garment for parents, and a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for children: a garment for poor, and a garment for rich: a garment for Magiſtrates, and a garment for Miniſters, and a garment for people: a garment for Jewes, and a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Gentiles. Chriſt is and will be to all his people, an ornament of grace here, and of glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p>I come now in the next place to ſhew you what kinde of garment Ieſus Chriſt is, and how he is to be worn; and I ſhall briefly give if you in theſe following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all, he is a precious garment: to you therefore which believe he is precious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. precious in regard of his nature, God and man; precious in regard of his worth and excellency, the chiefeſt and the choiceſt of ten thouſands; but I muſt not inſiſt upon theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt is a coſtly garment, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that's ſaid to be of great price, a garment of Gods own making, a garment that coſt a dear price, the precious life and blood of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. In a word, for I muſt be brief, he is a garment of more worth then all the world.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:108227:20"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is a cheap garment, the cheapeſt garment that ever thou woreſt in all thy life; thou mayeſt have this garment, as we uſe to ſay for God a mercy, he is freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to thee: <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: come ye, buy and eat, come buy wine and milk without money, and without price.</hi> Thou mayeſt have this garment for asking for; it is true, this garment coſt the deareſt price that ever any garment did, the Blood of God, one drop whereof is of more worth then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds; but Chriſtians, remember, this garment is paid for already, its purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God the Father for thee; ſhouldſt thou go about to buy it, thou couldſt never be able to purchaſe it; all thou haſt, nay, all that all the men in the world have, would never have been able to have bought this garment: <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t was onely the rich God, that God who hath all, and is all, that was onely able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe this precious, this coſtly, this excellent, no this glorious garment; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, thou mayeſt have him for nothing, he is freely tendered and offered to bee in the Goſpel of life: though it be a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y garment to God, yet it will be a cheap gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thee; God hath paid all, and there is nothing at all left for thee to pay, or to do,
<pb facs="tcp:108227:21"/>but to take him and put him on.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Ieſus Chriſt is a ſeamleſs gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Chriſts coat was ſeamleſs, ſo is his perſon ſeamleſs, there is no rent nor diviſions in this precious garment; and as there is no rents nor diviſions in Chriſt, ſo there ought to be none in Chriſtians: if there be no rent nor diviſions in the head, certainly there ought to be none in the Church, which is the body. And here beloved, we might take up a ſad and a bitter lamentation in conſideration of the ſad rents and diviſions that are now in the Church of Chriſt: whereas one ſaith, <hi>He is of Paul, and another of Apollos are we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carnal, 1 Cor. 1.</hi> Certainly beloved, theſe things ought not ſo to be, all the Saints of God, they ſhall all have one heaven, ſo they muſt all be ſaved by one faith: and therefore ſurely they ſhould all be of one heart, if not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> one minde; and therefore by the way, thoſe who go about to make rents and diviſions in the Church of God, doth not do Gods work but the Devils: the ſpirit of God is not a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diviſion, but of love, of peace, and a pure minde; and as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> calls <hi>ſeducer and faſe teachers, ungodly men, and ſeparate from the Church,</hi> are ſaid by <hi>Jude</hi> in his <hi>19</hi> verſe, <hi>to be ſenſual, and not to have the ſpirit</hi> And before I paſs this point, I hope it will
<pb facs="tcp:108227:21"/>not be amiſs to ſhew you the wickedneſs and ſin of thoſe who go about to make diviſions in the Church of Chriſt. And firſt of all, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of diviſions are renters of Chriſt; it is a horrible violence offered to the Body of Chriſt, a dividing of Chriſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it, in <hi>1 Cor. 1.13.</hi> it would make Chriſt ſeem to be the head of two bodies, a moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous conceit indeed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it reſiſteth the commands of Chriſt, which is love, and oppoſes the very end of Chriſt in dying for ſinners, which was that all his Saints ſhould be on.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, diviſion in the Church is very diſhonourable and injurious to the Church; for how can a body be rent and torn without prejudice: it hinders alſo the peace of the Church. Schiſmaticks, ſaith one, more oppoſe the peace of the Church then Heathens do; if the body be rent and torn, it is ſurely with much pain and ſmart; and tearing and renting in the Church will ſurely cut the very heart of one that's true Member of the Church. It makes the Saints mourn, and to be ſure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t makes the Devil laugh; therefore let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be rentleſs and ſeamleſs, as Chriſt is. To this end, in the firſt place labour after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, diviſion and ſeparation is a badge and mark of unholineſs; children in unholineſs are
<pb facs="tcp:108227:22"/>ever men in malice. Secondly, be not overtaken with new fancies and novelties; thoſe new lights which hath ſet the Church of God ſo much on fire in theſe our dayes, have all been taken out of the dark Lanthorns of old Hereticks and Ieſuits: all thoſe lights which receive not their light from the word of God, are all falſe lights and vapors that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear on purpoſe to draw men out of the may. Truth ſhould alwayes be imbraced, though it be never in ſo old a dreſs, they are itching ears that are moſt taken with novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Laſtly, diviſions beget ſenſuality, ſenſuality uſual follows ſeparation, even at the heels, ſeparating themſelves, ſaith <hi>Jude,</hi> ſenſual, <hi>not having the Spirit,</hi> not to ſpeak any more of this, our own ſad experience hath too manifeſtly witneſſed this for a truth. What horrid impiety, deſperate villanies have been committed by wicked and ungodly ſeducers in our dayes, my heart trembles with the very thought thereof.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is a ſpotleſs garment, there is not ſo much as a ſpark or ſpot in this garment; and therefore it is, that the Saints are ſaid in Scripture to be cloathed in white robes, <hi>Rev. 6.11.</hi> and that he offered himſelf without ſpot to God, <hi>Heb. 9.14.</hi> and the Saints are ſaid to be cloathed in fine linnen,
<pb facs="tcp:108227:22"/>white and clean, <hi>Rev. 19.14.</hi> and as Chriſt is ſpotleſs himſelf, ſo he takes away all ſpots and defilements from his people, they are waſhed in his blood, and therefore are ſaid to be clean by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John 13.10. John 15.3.</hi> and therefore he is called the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world, John 1.29.</hi> It was onely a ſinleſs Saviour that could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for and take away the ſins of ſinful men. If Chriſt had not been without ſpots himſelf, he could never have taken away out ſpots: he that was manifeſt, ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> to take away our ſin, <hi>in him was no ſin, 1 John 3.5. Chriſt hath ſuffered for us,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, 1 Pet. 2.21, 22. who did no ſinne, neither was guile found in his mouth;</hi> it is onely the blood of Chriſt that waſhes, and needs no waſhing: if he had not been without ſin, he could not have ſaved us from our ſins; nay, he himſelf then had ſtood in néed of a Saviour: &amp; although he took upon him our nature, and was made fleſh, ret the nature of Chriſt was a pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it ſelf; and therefore that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth moſt ſweetly expreſs this, where he ſayes of Chriſt, that he <hi>in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, condemned ſin in the fleſh, Rom. 8.3.</hi> and though he was in all things like unto us, yet ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 4.13.</hi> he was without ſin. Chriſt was not born in ſin, as we are, he
<pb facs="tcp:108227:23"/>was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and borne of a pure Virgin; its true, Chriſt was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yea, the greateſt of ſinners by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he having all the ſins of all the Elect of God laid upon him.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, had not Ieſus Chriſt been ſinleſs in himſelf, he had never been able to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſo heavy a burthen: Chriſt ſuffered not for his own ſins, but ſor our ſins; <hi>He his own ſelf</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>bore our ſinnes on the Croſs. We indeed,</hi> ſaith the converted thief on the Croſs, <hi>we ſuffer juſtly, but this man hath done nothing amiſs, Luke 23.41. He hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>2 Cor. 5.21. He did no violence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any guile found in this mouth, Iſa. 53.9.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Chriſt is a comely garment, a garment that will never be out of faſhion; <hi>He is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever:</hi> there is nothing ſo lovely and amiable in the eyes of Chriſtians as Chriſt is. Chriſtians I beſeech you conſider, you are never well dreſt till you have put on this garment, nor you ſhall never be bleſt without it.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Chriſt is a laſting, yea, an everlaſting garment, a garment that will laſt thee as long as thou libeſt, and will never be the worſe for wearing, but will alwayes be
<pb facs="tcp:108227:23"/>the better for wearing; the more thou weareſt this garment the more glorious it will be, and as this garment will laſt thee no long as thou liveſt, ſo thou mayeſt carry it along with thee when thou dyeſt; thou canſt not carry any thing of the world with thee; for naked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou into the world, and naked ſhall thou go out of the world; but if thou haſt put on Chriſt as a garment in thy life, thou canſt not leave him behinde thee when thou dyeſt, thou ſhalt carry this garment with thee into the next world. I ſhould come now to ſhew you how this garment is to be worn, but I ſhall ſpeak of that by way of Uſe and Application.</p>
                  <p>Now the Uſes that I ſhall make of this uſeful point, ſhall be theſe. Is it ſo that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a Chriſtians garment then in the firſt place I beſeech you obſerve the miſerable and wretched condition of wicked and ungodly men; men out of Chriſt they are naked, and have not, as we uſe to ſay of ſome poor people, a rag to cover their nakedneſs withal. Ah! ſinners, for the Lords ſake, for your precious and imnortal ſouls ſake, I beſeech you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and lay to heart a little your own moſt miſerable and ſad condition, how will you be able to ſtand in the day of the Lords wrath, how wilt thou be able to contend with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, when once he is angry, thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:108227:24"/>to ſhelter thée againſt the ſtorms and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lords indignation; I beſeech you then as you love your own ſouls, that you would now put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, O put him on, he is freely offered to thee, O then do not be ſo fooliſh, and Bedlam mad, as to refuſe him, if thou doeſt thou art undone for ever: art thou naked, and wilt not thou take this garment of Chriſt to cover thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs withal, conſider a little I beſeech thee thy own ſad condition as thou art in thy ſelf out of Chriſt. In the firſt place thou art liable to all Dangers, every ſinner out of Chriſt lies open to overy danger, every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thou enjoyeſt out of Chriſt is in wrath, thy preſervation is but by common providence, and its curſed as well as common, as one ſaith ſweetly. Thy preſervation is but a reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thee to the day of wrath, thou art kept, but remember, thou art kept but as a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to the day of execution, thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to guard thee from the wrath of God: it is poſſible thou mayeſt be ſecure in thy ſin, but remember thy ſecurity is not from want of danger, but from the want of diſcovery of that danger which is every day and hour hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thy head, and ready to fall upon thée; wert thou but once ſeriouſly ſenſible of that danger which every day thou art in, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb facs="tcp:108227:24"/>thou couldſt no more reſt in thy ſins out of Chriſt, then thou couldſt goe to bed when thy houſe is on fire about thy ears. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thou art, if our of Chriſt, in the power of every Devil and every luſt; thou art the devils for egreſs and regreſs, when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thou art taken captive by him at his will, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>2 Tim. 2.26.</hi> Thou art like a Common without a hedge, a prey to every beaſt of prey, thou wilt not take Chriſt as a garment, thou wilt not let God be a hedge to keep thee from ſtraying into ſin, and God will not be an hedge to preſerve thee from being deſtroyed in and for thy ſin. O ſinner, thy condition if very ſad and very dreadful, thou lieſt at the mercy of the devil every moment, at the cruel courteſie of every temptation; thou haſt a hole it may be to keep thy Swine in, but if thou haſt not a Chriſt to lodge thy ſoul in, thou art liable to all the curſes in the book of God; how dreadful is it to want the benefit of every ſweet promiſe in the word of God, to want a Ieſus to deliver us from the wrath to come. Doeſt thou think thou canſt be able to endure the wrath of God to all eternity; if thy foundation be not laid upon the rock of Chriſt, thy whole building will ſoon be deſtroyed, and thou wilt be found to be the verieſt fool in the world; if thou
<pb facs="tcp:108227:25"/>art out of Chriſt thou canſt never be ſafe, thou art a mad man, and thou delighteſt in thy own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by way of motive conſider I be. ſéech you, Chriſt will not onely cover thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and ſhelter thee from the wrath of God, but will be an ornament of grace and glory to thee for ever; but how ſhall we get this garment of Chriſt, may ſome ſay? I ſee my own nakedneſs, but how ſhall I do to get this garment? I anſwer, in the firſt place, thou muſt beg it of God, thou mayeſt have it for asking for; ask and thou ſhalt have, it is freely offered unto thee. Secondly, throw away all thy own rotten rags of ſin, thou muſt ſtrip thy ſelf even naked of all ſelf, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Chriſt will not be a garment to any but to ſuch as ſhall firſt put off their own rags, throw away then all thy old rotten rags, and <hi>put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> put him on, he is freely offered to thee, do not deſpiſe thy own mercy; get Chriſt for thy garment here, it ever thou expecteſt to have Chriſt for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort hereafter. Remember without Chriſt there is no happineſs to be had hereafter, thou art miſerable here, and thou ſhalt be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all eternity hereafter. <hi>O conſider this, all ye that forget God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you, Pſalm 50.22.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108227:25"/>In the next place, is it ſo, is Chriſt a garment, then here is matter of great joy and comfort, to thoſe that are Chriſts: O happy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, God hath made a bleſſed exchange with thee, the hath taken away from thee thy own rotten filthy ſtinking rags, and he hath in the room thereof put thee on his own moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious white Robes! O happy ſoul! O bleſſed exchange. But before I proceed any further, I ſhall a little endeavour to give you ſome few, but brief directions for your better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of all, haſt thou put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt as a garment, O then for the Lords ſake do not put him off again, keep him on while thou haſt him on; children you know when they have gotten a new garment they do not love to put it off again, they would wear it alwayes if they might.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, haſt thou put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt as a garment, then wear him clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, have a care that thou doeſt not ſoil this precious garment; O do not dirty it, nor ſully it. Men when they have gotten on their beſt garments, or any thing that's rare and choice, how curious, how careful, how circumſpect are they, they will have a care where they go, and what they do ſo long as they have thoſe garments on. Men will not go about to rake
<pb facs="tcp:108227:26"/>dunghills in ſilken garment, a little ſpot of duſt is ſoon ſeen in a clean garment; do not do the Devils drudgery with the garment of Chriſt: do not rake in the ſilthy ſtinking dunghills of ſinne, with the ſilken cloaths of Chriſtianity upon thy back; remember ſuch baſe things are too low, for ſuch noble ſouls as Chriſtians are, to be imployed in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is Chriſt a garment, then wear him as a garment, put him not on as a cloak, but put him on as a garment; remember, as one ſaith ſweetly, as Chriſt is the beſt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo is he the worſt cloak: for to make Chriſt and Chriſtianity a cloak for thy ſin, is the horredſt thing in all the world. Thoſe wolves who are in ſheeps cloathing are the moſt dangerous wolves of all; to be Saints in appearance outwardly, and Devils in ſub, ſtance inwardly, O horrid impiety! will you ſwear and lye, couzen and cheat, and do all manner of evil, and yet profeſs Chriſtanity; O take heed of this, they that make Chriſt a Cloak for their ſin, do manifeſtly ſhew that they never yet taſted of the love of God in Chriſt, in the pardoning of their ſins; Chriſt is not a cloak to hide ſin, but Chriſt is a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to preſerve us from ſin; they that put on Chriſt as a cloak, never yet put on Chriſt as a garment.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:108227:26"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, is Chriſt a garment, and haſt thou put him on, then wear him conſtantly, never put him off, he will laſt thee as long as thou liveſt, I and longer too; thou canſt not carry a rag of thine own clothes with thee our of this world? I but thou mayeſt carry this garment with thee into the next world, thou mayeſt go to heaven with this garment upon thee, nay, thou ſhalt never get to heaven without it; put him on then, and never put him off, wear him every day, day by day, even to thy dying day, he will laſt thee as long as thou liveſt, and will be a comfort, yea, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great comfort to thee when thou dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and will be a glory, an everlaſting glory to thee for ever in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, is it ſo, is Chriſt a garment? then here is matter of comfort to all that are Chriſts in times of danger and trouble; let me tell thee Chriſtian, thou that haſt put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt as a garment, thou art armed as well as clothed, thou haſt armour of proof upon thy back, ſuch armour as never yet could be pierced, ſuch armour as will keep off all the gun-ſhots of the Devil, and the world, be they never ſo great, be they never ſo ſurious, be they never ſo many: thy garment Chriſtian will keep out a ſhowre, I, and a ſtorm too, nothing can pierce it, nothing ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:108227:27"/>be able to hurt thee if thou haſt put on Chriſt, neither ſin nor Satan: <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us, Rom. 8.31. Rom. 8.33. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is Chriſt that hath dyed.</hi> Firſt, thou haſt put on Chriſt as a garment, he will defend thee Jle warrant thee, let come what will come; ſee what the Lord ſaith to ſuch as are clothed with his Son, in <hi>Iſa. 47.1, 2. Feare not for I have redceemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine. When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt; neither ſhall the flame kindle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</hi> And this was it which ſo raviſhed the hearts of the bleſſed Martyrs, and carried them through all their torments with ſo much joy and comfort; and ſo likewiſe the three Children in the fiery furnace, all the violent and ſcorching heats of thoſe burning fiery furances, could not, nay did not burt ſo much as the leaſt hair of their heads; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, becauſe they were the Children of the moſt high God, and were cloathed with the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as with a garment. So likewiſe <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions Den, he was defonded from the fury of thoſe raging beaſts, by his being clothed with this garment of
<pb facs="tcp:108227:27"/>Chriſt. In a word, let come what will come, let the Devil and all his inſtruments rage never ſo much, let the ſtorms of perſecution be never ſo hot, let the waves beat never ſo fiercely, thy houſe ſhall ſtand, and thou ſhalt be cartied through all, becauſe thy houſe, thy faith is built upon a Rock even upon the rock of Ages, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Ben out of Chriſt are naked, they have nothing at all to defend them, all thoſe rich and coſtly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the gallants of the world, be they never ſo rich and gaudy, are not half ſo coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as this garment is; for believe it Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, it coſt Chriſts precious Life and Blood to purchaſe it for thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, is Chriſt a garment, then let us not he proud of our own garments: alas, what are they, nothing but rags in compart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this garment of Chriſt, bodies of ſin; ſinne was the firſt founder and inventer of them: if Adam had not ſinned, he had never ſtood in need of garment. A thief (ſaith one very ſwéetly) may as well be proud of his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a man or woman may be proud of their garments; and let me tell thee, thou that art proud, thou art proud of that which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, if is none of thy own, thou haſt nothing of thy own to be proud with; what thou haſt is but lent thee, and thou knoweſt not how ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:108227:28"/>the owner may take them away, and leave thee as naked as he found thee, and then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fiſhly, is Chriſt a garment, then J note from hence, that abundance of outward enſoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do nothing at all adorn a man, its onely the garment of Chriſt that will make a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian lovely; earthly things they doe not adorn us in the ſight of Bod; it matters no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
